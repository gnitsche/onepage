# "ONEPAGE"
### The responsive single page

My version of a lightweight single page written in SASS. It is free to use.<br />
The page is perfect for representing (including a form field, "about you" part, "your projects" ... )

##### Features:
- responsive
- handy bottom menu
- changeable themes
- js form validation
- parallax effect on image

:warning: __Status__: In development!

### My intention

> I want a simple responsive fast loading HTML page.<br />
> On mobile phones you can navigate with only one hand!

### Solution 

1. One page view
2. Using a simple grid framework (http://zengrids.com/)
3. Develop in SASS (http://sass-lang.com/)
4. Using jQuery but code many scripts by myself
5. as little http requests as possible
	* Inline SVG
	* combine javascript (TODO)
6. compress files
	* CSS (TODO)
	* jquery
	* js (TODO)
