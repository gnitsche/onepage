# "ONEPAGE"
### The responsive single page

My version of a lightweight single page written in SASS. It is free to use. The page is perfect to represent you - with its form field, "about you" part, "your projects" ... 

##### Features:
- responsive
- parallax effect on image
- js form validation
- handy bottom menu

:warning: __Status__: In development!


### My intention

> I want a simple responsive fast loading HTML page.
> You can navigate mobile with only one hand!

### Solution 

1. One page view
2. Using a simple grid framework (http://zengrids.com/)
3. Develop in SASS (http://sass-lang.com/)
4. Using jQuery but code many scripts by myself
5. as little http requests as possible
	* Inline SVG
	* combine javascript (TODO)
6. compress files
	* CSS (TODO)
	* jquery
	* js (TODO)
	
	
### Solve bugs

1. JS: Menu button fade In/Out bug in combination with scrolling in Firefox
